# **Most Likely To ... A Project Challenge**
 

We were given a challenge to form teams of 3/4 and create a Ruby Terminal App that would meet the following criteria:

  - Be made up of an idea which is either: funny, crazy, whacky, clever etc
  - Classes : 3 or more
  - Gems: 2 or more
  - Design Process: true
  - Tests: 2 per class

# Getting Started

### *Gem Installations*

Gems that you will need to install:

| Gem | Installation | Usage |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| terminal-table | $ gem install terminal-table | require 'terminal-table' |
| catpix | $ gem install catpix | require 'catpix' |

#### *Installing a Gem*

To install the gem terminal-table type the following in your terminal:
```sh
$ gem install terminal-table
```
Do this for each of the gems listed in the table above, typing in their installation code into the terminal.

### *Usage*

# Our Design Journey/Process

#### *Step One: Brainstorm Session*

We sat down in our groups and started brainstorming ideas which were all based around an application that had some kind of personal reference to our teacher.

#### *Step 2: Building on Ideas*

After our spider diagram we focused on three of the best points and how we could build on those ideas.

Idea # 1:

> A Whisky Generator: 
> that suggests and recommends a brand of Whisky
> based on the user's input to questions they
> are asked relating to 'occasion', 'number of people',
> 'price wanting to spend' and 'availability'.
> Depending on his answers, the whisky generator 
> would suggest a brand of Whisky that would 
> meet those requirements.

Idea # 2:

> An insult Generator:
> User would input different names and catergories 
> and the generator would spit out a funny insult. 

Idea # 3:

> Quiz:
> Have a quiz where not only the teachers are 
> involved in answering the questions, 
> but we also get some kind of interaction with the
> whole class as well.

#### *Step 3: Chosen Idea*
Once we had chosen the idea of a Quiz we sorted out a to-do list of features we wanted and how to implement them. 
We discussed the format of the code and broke it into classes and methods, the different gems we could utilize, and the APIs required.
